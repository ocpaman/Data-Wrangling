# Data-Wrangling
For this project, we gathered data from three different sources i.e Twitter API, website and .csv file. Detect and document at least eight (8) quality issues and two (2) tidiness issues in a Dataset. Store the clean DataFrame(s) in a CSV file. Analyze and visualize wrangled data in a Jupyter Notebook. At least three (3) insights and one (1) visualization was produced. Created a written report that communicates the insights and displays the visualization(s) produced from wrangled data.
